Multilevel Feedback-Queue Scheduling Algorithm
	- Allows processes to move between queues
	- According CPU bursts 
	- If CPU Use too much CPU time it's moved to a lower priority queue
	- A Process that waits too long in lower priority queue may moves to higher priority queue
	- Parameters
		* Number of Queues
		* Scheduling Algorithm for each queue
		* The method used to determine when to upgrade a process to a higher priority queue
		* The method used to determine when to demote (downgrade) a process to a lower priority queue
		* The method used to determine which queue a process will enter when that process needs service
